# Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website I created using HTML and basic CSS. The website consists of two pages: the home page and the contact page.

## Pages

1. **Home Page**: This page showcases my latest projects with brief descriptions and links for further exploration. It also provides information about my skills and expertise.

2. **Contact Page**: The contact page offers ways to reach out to me for collaboration, inquiries, or any other purposes. It includes a contact form and details such as email address and social media links.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to access the home page.
3. Navigate to `contact.html` to access the contact page.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your preferences!
